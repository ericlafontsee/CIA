# CIA Mock-Up

## Description
This is a landing page mock-up for Conversion Interactive Agency. I chose to use React to build this page because it keeps the file structure neat and offers dom rerendering. It offers easy integration with npm packages, Bootstrap, animations, etc., making the build much quicker.
